Command injection is the abuse of an application's behaviour to execute commands on the operating system, using the same privileges that the application on a device is running with. For example, achieving command injection on a web server running as a user named `joe` will execute commands under this `joe` user - and therefore obtain any permissions that `joe` has.

Command injection is also often known as “Remote Code Execution” (RCE) because of the ability to remotely execute code within an application. These vulnerabilities are often the most lucrative to an attacker because it means that the attacker can directly interact with the vulnerable system. For example, an attacker may read system or user files, data, and things of that nature.

This vulnerability exists because applications often use functions in programming languages such as PHP, Python and NodeJS to pass data to and to make system calls on the machine’s operating system. For example, taking input from a field and searching for an entry into a file

**1.** The application stores MP3 files in a directory contained on the operating system.

**2.** The user inputs the song title they wish to search for. The application stores this input into the `$title` variable.

**3.** The data within this `$title` variable is passed to the command `grep` to search a text file named _songtitle.__txt_ for the entry of whatever the user wishes to search for.

**4.** The output of this search of _songtitle.__txt_ will determine whether the application informs the user that the song exists or not.

An attacker could abuse this application by injecting their own commands for the application to execute. Rather than using `grep` to search for an entry in `songtitle.txt`, they could ask the application to read data from a more sensitive file.

Abusing applications in this way can be possible no matter the programming language the application uses. As long as the application processes and executes it, it can result in command injection

1. The "flask" package is used to set up a web server
2. A function that uses the "subprocess" package to execute a command on the device
3. We use a route in the webserver that will execute whatever is provided. For example, to execute `whoami`, we'd need to visit \http://flaskapp.thm/whoami


Applications that use user input to populate system commands with data can often be combined in unintended behaviour. **For example, the shell operators `;`, `&` and `&&` will combine two (or more) system commands and execute them both**

Command Injection can be detected in mostly one of two ways:

1. Blind command injection
2. Verbose command injection



|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Method**|**Description**|
|Blind|This type of injection is where there is no direct output from the application when testing payloads. You will have to investigate the behaviours of the application to determine whether or not your payload was successful.|
|Verbose|This type of injection is where there is direct feedback from the application once you have tested a payload. For example, running the `whoami` command to see what user the application is running under. The web application will output the username on the page directly.|



Detecting Blind Command Injection

Blind command injection is when command injection occurs; however, there is no output visible, so it is not immediately noticeable. For example, a command is executed, but the web application outputs no message.

***For this type of command injection, we will need to use payloads that will cause some time delay. For example, the `ping` and `sleep` commands are significant payloads to test with. Using `ping` as an example, the application will hang for _x_ seconds in relation to how many pings you have specified.
Another method of detecting blind command injection is by forcing some output. This can be done by using redirection operators such as `>`.
For example, we can tell the web application to execute commands such as `whoami` and redirect that to a file. We can then use a command such as `cat` to read this newly created file’s contents.***




Detecting Verbose Command Injection

Detecting command injection this way is arguably the easiest method of the two. Verbose command injection is when the application gives you feedback or output as to what is happening or being executed.

For example, the output of commands such as `ping` or `whoami` is directly displayed on the web application.

For Linux

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Payload**|**Description**|
|whoami|See what user the application is running under.|
|ls|List the contents of the current directory. You may be able to find files such as configuration files, environment files (tokens and application keys), and many more valuable things.|
|ping|This command will invoke the application to hang. This will be useful in testing an application for blind command injection.|
|sleep|This is another useful payload in testing an application for blind command injection, where the machine does not have `ping` installed.|
|nc|Netcat can be used to spawn a reverse shell onto the vulnerable application. You can use this foothold to navigate around the target machine for other services, files, or potential means of escalating privileges.|


For Windows

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Payload**|**Description**|
|whoami|See what user the application is running under.|
|dir|List the contents of the current directory. You may be able to find files such as configuration files, environment files (tokens and application keys), and many more valuable things.|
|ping|This command will invoke the application to hang. This will be useful in testing an application for blind command injection.|
|timeout|This command will also invoke the application to hang. It is also useful for testing an application for blind command injection if the `ping` command is not installed.|


---

Command injection can be prevented in a variety of ways. Everything from minimal use of potentially dangerous functions or libraries in a programming language to filtering input without relying on a user’s input.

**Vulnerable Functions**

In PHP, many functions interact with the operating system to execute commands via shell; these include:

- Exec
- Passthru
- System


the application will only accept and process numbers that are inputted into the form. This means that any commands such as `whoami` will not be processed.


![[inputsanitisation.png]]


1. The application will only accept a specific pattern of characters (the digits  0-9)
2. The application will then only proceed to execute this data which is all numerical.


**Input sanitisation**

Sanitising any input from a user that an application uses is a great way to prevent command injection. This is a process of specifying the formats or types of data that a user can submit. For example, an input field that only accepts numerical data or removes any special characters such as `>` ,  `&` and `/`.

Bypassing Filters

Applications will employ numerous techniques in filtering and sanitising data that is taken from a  user's input. These filters will restrict you to specific payloads; however, we can abuse the logic behind an application to bypass these filters. For example, an application may strip out quotation marks; ***we can instead use the hexadecimal value of this to achieve the same result.***

When executed, although the data given will be in a different format than what is expected, it can still be interpreted and will have the same result.
